intro: The Hall of Preserving Harmony (Chinese:保和殿) was built in the 18th year of the Ming dynasty (1420) and was known as the Hall of Honour(谨身殿) at the beginning of the Ming dynasty, before being renamed the Hall of Jianji (建极殿) in the 41st year of the Ming dynasty (1562) and The Hall of Preserving Harmony in the 2nd year of the Qing dynasty (1645). 
intro2: The Hall of Preserving Harmony was used differently in the Ming and Qing dynasties, where the emperor used to change his clothes before the Ming dynasty ceremonies, and when the empress and the crown prince was crowned, the emperor was congratulated in this hall. In the Qing dynasty, every year on New Year's Eve and the 15th day of the first month, the emperor gave a feast to foreign clans, princes and ministers of one or two grades, which were very spectacular scenes. In addition, the family feast and each of the Imperial examinations are held in The Hall of Preserving Harmony.
