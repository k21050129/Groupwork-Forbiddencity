intro: The name of Eternal Spring Palace means eternal youth symbolized by spring. It used to be residences of imperial concubines. After Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty ascended the throne, the palace was rebuilt in 1683 and later renovated many times. The biggest renovation was in 1859, when the inner gate of the palace was dismantled so as to connect with the neighbouring Hall of the Supreme Principle.
intro2: The most remarkable detail of the palace is a corridor painted with 18 Suzhou-style frescos depicting scenes from the "Dream of the Red Chamber" by Cao Xueqin Skill. The mural paintings are exquisite and elegant, showing the exquisite craftsmanship and profound skills of painters in the late Qing Dynasty.The palace also has a veranda near Tiyuan hall converted into an opera stage, where Peking opera performances were performed for Empress Dowager Cixi.
time: the Yongle era in 1420
