intro: The Hall of Central Harmony (Chinese:中和殿), built in 1420 in the 18th year of the Ming dynasty, was known as the Hall of Huagai (华盖殿) in the early Ming dynasty. It was rebuilt after a fire during the Jiajing period and was renamed the 'Zhongji Hall'(中极殿), with the Ming Dynasty 'Zhongji Hall' ink still remaining on the ceiling. In the first year of the Qing dynasty (1644), the Qing imperial family moved into the Forbidden City, and the following year the Zhongji Hall was renamed the Hall of Central Harmony. 
intro2: In the Ming and Qing dynasties, before the various ceremonies held in The Hall of Supreme Harmony, the emperor first took a break in The Hall of Central Harmony and received a pilgrimage from the deacon's officials.
