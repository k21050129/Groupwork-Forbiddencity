intro: Palace of Earthly Honor was originally named Palace of Ten Thousand Peace. In 1535, the palace was renamed as Palace of Earthly Honor by Jiajing Emperor. The current name of the palace corresponds with the name of Palace of Earthly ranquility and means "assisting the ruler of earth ". In a nutshell, the name of palace indicates the status of imperial consort being assistant empress. Paradoxally, the palace wasn't a residence exclusively reserved for highly ranking imperial consorts (like noble consorts, imperial noble consorts and empresses). On grant ceremonies, empress dowager Cixi would receive respects here from imperial concubines. And on her fiftieth birthday in 1884, the empress dowager Cixi once received congratulations from courtiers here. In 1889, the palace was used to select women who will become the emperor's concubines.
time: the Yongle era in 1420
